# The European NGI fund must be renewed
As a long-time Open Source user (and modest contributor) I firmly believe it is crucial for
Europe to ascertain its position as the prime worldwide software innovation factory.

Projects such as the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) showcase how these initiatives pave the
way for those 'finished' and 'usable' products the industry so fervently seeks, implying productivity
would not be negatively impacted by investments in Open Source. Even though it is heartbreaking to
have to allude to productivity and economic metrics to make a believable argument that's where we
are now I guess...

With member states such as Spain investing huge amounts of money on reinventing technologies such as
a secure communications infrastructure it's time we begin appreciating what we here in Europe are
capable of creating. That appreciation should come in the way of funding through programs such as
NGI.

The following open letter (whose original can be found [here](https://pad.public.cat/lettre-NCP-NGI))
sets forth all of these ideas.

## Open Letter to the European Commission
Since 2020, Next Generation Internet ([NGI](https://www.ngi.eu)) programmes, part of European Commission's Horizon programme, fund free software in Europe
using a cascade funding mechanism (see for example [NGI0  Commons Fund](https://www.nlnet.nl/commonsfund)). This year, according to the Horizon Europe
working draft detailing funding programmes for 2025, we notice that Next Generation Internet is not mentioned any more as part of Cluster 4.

NGI programmes have shown their strength and importance to supporting the European software infrastructure, as a generic funding instrument to fund digital
commons and ensure their long-term sustainability. We find this transformation incomprehensible, moreover when NGI has proven efficient and economical to
support free software as a whole, from the smallest to the most established initiatives. This ecosystem diversity backs the strength of European
technological innovation, and maintaining the NGI initiative to provide structural support to software projects at the heart of worldwide innovation
is key to enforce the sovereignty of a European infrastructure.

Contrary to common perception, technical innovations often originate from European rather than North American programming communities, and are mostly
initiated by small-scaled organisations.

Previous Cluster 4 allocated 27 million euros to:

- "Human centric Internet aligned with values and principles commonly shared in Europe" ;
- "A flourishing internet, based on common building blocks created within NGI, that enables better control of our digital life" ;
- "A structured ecosystem of talented contributors driving the creation of new internet commons and the evolution of existing internet commons".

In the name of these challenges, more than 500 projects received NGI funding in the first 5 years, backed by 18 organisations managing these
European funding consortia.

NGI contributes to a vast ecosystem, as most of its budget is allocated to fund third parties by the means of open calls, to structure commons that
cover the whole Internet scope - from hardware to application, operating systems, digital identities or data traffic supervision. This third-party
funding is not renewed in the current program, leaving many projects short on resources for research and innovation in Europe.

Moreover, NGI allows exchanges and collaborations across all the Euro zone countries as well as "widening countries", currently both a success
and an ongoing progress, likewise the Erasmus programme before us. NGI also contributes to opening and supporting longer relationships than
strict project funding does. It encourages implementing projects funded as pilots, backing collaboration, identification and reuse of common
elements across projects, interoperability in identification systems and beyond, and setting up development models that mix diverse scales
and types of European funding schemes.

While the USA, China or Russia deploy huge public and private resources to develop software and infrastructure that massively capture
private consumer data, the EU can't afford this renunciation.

Free and open source software, as supported by NGI since 2020, is by design the opposite of potential vectors for foreign interference. It lets
us keep our data local and favors a community-wide economy and know-how, while allowing an international collaboration.

This is all the more essential in the current geopolitical context: the challenge of technological sovereignty is central, and free software
allows to address it while acting for peace and sovereignty in the digital world as a whole.

In this perspective, we urge you to claim for preserving the NGI programme as part of the 2025 funding programme.
