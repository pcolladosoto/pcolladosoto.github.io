# We need to work a bit to use Hugo's default Chroma highlighter...
# Check https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/ for
# more info on Chroma. Bear in mind if we want to use `lineNos: true`
# we MUST include `noClasses: true` so that backgrounds appear okay.
# The thing is, we need to generate the classes for highlighting manually
# with a Hugo command as seen on the following site:
# https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#generate-syntax-highlighter-css.
# We also need to set `background-color: unset !important;` on the `.chroma` class in the
# generated CSS file as seen on:
# https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/FAQs#using-hugos-syntax-highlighter-chroma.
