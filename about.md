This site is just a collection of ideas and projects that I believe could be useful to someone, isn't that what the internet was for? If that doesn't work out, I at least don't have to keep on cloning and browsing repositories to look for documentation that's scattered all around :ok_woman:

## Who are you again?
Call me Pablo (I actually haven't read Moby Dick :whale:). I studied Telematics Engineering at the Universidad de Alcalá in Madrid, Spain. Telematics is nothing more than a branch of Telecommunications dealing mostly with networks such as the Internet or the cell phone provider infrastructures we all so commonly use.

Even though I'm not a programmer, I do find it amusing to try and embark on some projects from time to time. In tackling some of them I come across issues that I end up solving (if you could call that a solve) thanks to the help of a ton of individuals that share what they know expecting nothing in return. Eventually, I figured this could be a way of giving a bit (much less than what I have received) back and so, here goes nothing.

If you have any questions or suggestions about anything you find on the site feel free to drop me an email: I would be delighted to get as much feedback as I possibly can.

## And did you code all this site?
Nope: I still have some nightmares about misbehaving `<divs>` and CSS animations, no kidding. This page relies on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [TeXt](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) theme (which we absolutely love :heart_eyes_cat:) and it's published through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). You can also find the real, raw content of the site on its [repository](https://github.com/pcolladosoto/pcolladosoto.github.io).

Setting it all up is not too harsh, so I encourage anybody to give it a go!
